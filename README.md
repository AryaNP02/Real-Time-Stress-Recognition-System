# Real-Time Stress Recognition System

## Overview
The proposed real-time stress recognition system aims to detect, recognize, and classify human emotions, focusing on emotions such as happiness, anger, and neutrality. Using facial expressions captured through computer vision techniques, the system achieves high accuracy in emotion classification, particularly in identifying stress-related states.


## Key Features

- Real-Time Stress Detection: Utilizes computer vision and machine learning models to detect and classify human emotions, focusing on stress-related states in real-time.
  
- Emotion Classification: Targets primary emotions such as happiness, anger, and neutrality, crucial for identifying stress levels and emotional states.

- High Accuracy and Reliability: Achieves exceptional accuracy in emotion classification, particularly in distinguishing stress-related facial expressions, ensuring reliable stress recognition in various environments.



## Module Use
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- scikit-learn
- Tensorflow
  
## Classifier Performance

| Classifier    | Accuracy  |
